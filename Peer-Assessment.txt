Peer Assessment Team 41

We are 6 people, so we have 6*20=120 points to allocate.


25 Chris Mouzouris
18 Umar Ndayako
0  Jacob Poole
32 Greg Pyemont
25 David Pomerenke

20 Steven Liang

Please note:
- Jacob is a ghost, who only showed up in the initial meeting.
- Steven has submitted his own project via mail, as he could not collaborate with us from China due to the pandemic. We assign 20 to Steven as a "neutral" grade, as his contributions before he left were about average. We did, however, not assess Steven's project after leaving. We would like to ask you to assess his project separately from ours. It looks like he put lots of work into it, so probably he deserves a better grade. But as he did not contribute this to our project, we do not want to include it in our grading.
- We asked Steven by mail for his opinion on the grading, but he ignored the point in his reply, so we assume he agrees. Umar was not online during the scheduled time for doing the peer grading, so we could not ask for his opinion. The points are thus allocated only by Greg, Chris, and David.
